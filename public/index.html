  <p>You are looking at this page, this could mean one of two things.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>You Are A Participant</li>
    <li>You Are too curious to see what others have built</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Here I will address the first group, if you came to explore feel free to look around ( you might be able to find
    something ðŸ˜‰ ) !</p>
  <h2 id="getting-started" style="display: inline-block;">Getting Started</h2>
  <div style="display: inline-block;">
    <div id="firebaseui-auth-container"></div>
    <div id="loader">Loading...</div>
  </div>
  <p>To participate in this Hacknight all you have to do is build something cool using GitHub API. Here are some
    ideas to get your creativity flowing,</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>CV Maker</strong> - This is a webpage where people can get their CV generated using data from their
      github profile. You can stop there or add some crazy features and blow us away!
    </li>
    <li><strong>Follow The Tree</strong> - Simply put this is a webpage where people come to feel
      <code>not</code>lonely. Users should be able to generate a tree of their follower by entering in their username.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Random Repo</strong> - This is a page for those who like to explore. The idea is each time you refresh
      the page you will be show a list of random repos to explore. </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="submitting-your-creations">Submitting Your Creations</h2>
  <p>You all must be used to submitting something after you are done building, but here it is the other way around (
    twist... twist ! ).</p>
  <p>Here is what to do,</p>
  <h3 id="step-1">Step 1</h3>
  <p><strong>Create a repo</strong> This shouldn&#39;t need any more explanation but still, the team lead should create
    a repo in which you will be building the project.</p>
  <h3 id="step-2">Step 2</h3>
  <p><strong>Create or Join a Team</strong> If you are the team lead, you should create a team here and add members to
    the team. The team members will get an invite to their mail once the team is created.</p>
  <h3 id="step-3">Step 3</h3>
  <p><strong>Start Codding</strong> Finally! You can start making your dream project. At this point, our team will be
    monitoring your progress and giving you timely updates. Try to commit code frequently so that we can get back to you
    in case of any error.</p>
  <h2 id="for-further-queries">For Further Queries</h2>
  <p>If you still have something unclear you can ping us on Discord or ask away in the Saturday Hack Night Channel.</p>
