      TinkerHub brings you Saturday Hack Night!
    </p>

    <p class="break-words mt-2">
      Saturday Hack Night is not just your regular hackathon. Here, you will be
      building solutions/applications via API integration on every third Sunday
      of the month. <br /><br />
      The needed resources, the respective API and documentation will be shared
      with you once you register. All you have to do is brainstorm and come up
      with a solution for your problem with the given API. Once you are done
      with referring the documentation provided, team up (or even go solo!) and
      join the <a href="https://join.tinkerhub.org">Discord server</a> to take
      part in an exhilarating evening. The problem statement will be published
      on Saturday evening and you will have the whole night to build.
      <br /><br />Stay tuned on TinkerHub Discord channels and
      <a href="https://instagram.com/tinkerhub">Instagram page</a> for the
      latest information and clues!
